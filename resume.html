                    I am a passionate and adaptable engineering student at Rizvi College of Engineering (Mumbai University), pursuing a degree in Computer Engineering (AI & Data Science) while also exploring Mechanical Engineering and GATE preparation. With strong foundations in Python, C, C++, Java, and Data Structures & Algorithms, I am building hands-on projects ranging from algorithmic problem-solving to Arduino-based embedded systems.

I enjoy learning new technologies, solving challenging problems, and building practical projects that connect theory with real-world applications. My long-term vision is to contribute to fields like Artificial Intelligence, Robotics, and Space Technology, leveraging a unique blend of software and mechanical engineering knowledge.
